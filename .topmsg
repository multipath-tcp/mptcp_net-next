Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: fix a DSS option writing error

'ptr += 1;' was omitted in the original code.

If the DSS is the last option -- which is what we have most of the
time -- that's not an issue. But it is if we need to send something else
after like a RM_ADDR or an MP_PRIO.

Fixes: 1bff1e43a30e ("mptcp: optimize out option generation")
