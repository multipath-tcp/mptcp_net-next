Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: pm: only decrement add_addr_accepted for MPJ req

Adding the following warning ...

  WARN_ON_ONCE(msk->pm.add_addr_accepted == 0)

... before decrementing the add_addr_accepted counter helped to find a
bug when running the "remove single subflow" subtest from the
mptcp_join.sh selftest.

Removing a 'subflow' endpoint will first trigger a RM_ADDR, then the
subflow closure. Before this patch, and upon the reception of the
RM_ADDR, the other peer will then try to decrement this
add_addr_accepted. That's not correct because the attached subflows have
not been created upon the reception of an ADD_ADDR.

A way to solve that is to decrement the counter only if the attached
subflow was an MP_JOIN to a remote id that was not 0, and initiated by
the host receiving the RM_ADDR.

Fixes: d0876b2284cf ("mptcp: add the incoming RM_ADDR support")
