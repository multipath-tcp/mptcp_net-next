Subject: [PATCH] tcp: remove sk_{tr}x_skb_cache

This reverts the following patches :

- commit 2e05fcae83c4 ("tcp: fix compile error if !CONFIG_SYSCTL")
- commit 4f661542a402 ("tcp: fix zerocopy and notsent_lowat issues")
- commit 472c2e07eef0 ("tcp: add one skb cache for tx")
- commit 8b27dae5a2e8 ("tcp: add one skb cache for rx")

Having a cache of one skb (in each direction) per TCP socket is fragile,
since it can cause a significant increase of memory needs,
and not good enough for high speed flows anyway where more than one skb
is needed.

We want instead to add a generic infrastructure, with more flexible
per-cpu caches, for alien NUMA nodes.
