Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: full disconnect implementation

The current mptcp_disconnect() implementation lacks several
steps, we additionally need to reset the msk socket state
and flush the subflow list.

Factor out the needed helper to avoid code duplication.

Additionally ensure that the initial subflow is disposed
only after mptcp_close(), just reset it at disconnect time.
