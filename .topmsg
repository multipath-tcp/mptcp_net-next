Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: refactor shutdown and close

We must not close the subflows before all the MPTCP level
data, comprising the DATA_FIN has been acked at the MPTCP
level, otherwise we could be unable to retransmit as needed.

__mptcp_wr_shutdown() shutdown is responsible to check for the
correct status and close all subflows. Is called by the output
path after spooling any data and at shutdown/close time.

In a similar way, __mptcp_destroy_sock() is responsible to clean-up
the MPTCP level status, and is called when the msk transition
to TCP_CLOSE.

The protocol level close() does not force anymore the TCP_CLOSE
status, but orphan the msk socket and all the subflows.
Orphaned msk sockets are forciby closed after a timeout or
when all MPTCP-level data is acked.

There is a caveat about keeping the orphaned subflows around:
the TCP stack can asynchronusly call tcp_cleanup_ulp() on them via
tcp_close(). To prevent accessing freed memory on later MPTCP
level operations, the msk acquires a reference to each subflow
socket and prevent subflow_ulp_release() from releasing the
subflow context before __mptcp_destroy_sock().

The additional subflow references are released by __mptcp_done()
and the async ULP release is detected checking ULP ops. If such
field has been already cleared by the ULP release path, the
dangling context is freed directly by __mptcp_done().
