Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: fix msk traversal in mptcp_nl_cmd_set_flags()

The MPTCP endpoint list is under RCU protection, guarded by the
pernet spinlock. mptcp_nl_cmd_set_flags() traverses the list
without acquiring the spin-lock nor under the RCU critical section.

This change addresses the issue performing the lookup and the endpoint
update under the pernet spinlock.
