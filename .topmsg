Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: fix DATA_FIN processing for orphaned sockets

Currently we move orphaned msk sockets directly from FIN_WAIT2
state to CLOSE, with the rationale that incoming additional
data could be just dropped by the TCP stack/TW sockets.

Anyhow we miss sending MPTCP-level ack on incoming DATA_FIN,
and that may hang the peers.
