Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: add basic kselftest program

create mptcp connection between two processes, xmit data back and
forth.  Data is read from stdin and written (after traversing mtcp
connection twice) to stdout.

Wrapper script tests that data has passed un-altered.

Will run automatically on "make kselftest".
