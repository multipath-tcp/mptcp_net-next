Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: skip connecting the connected address

This patch added a new helper named lookup_subflow_by_daddr to find
whether the destination address is in the msk's conn_list.

In mptcp_pm_nl_add_addr_received, use lookup_subflow_by_daddr to check
whether the announced address is already connected. If it is, skip
connecting this address and send out the echo.
