Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: move page frag allocation in mptcp_sendmsg()

mptcp_sendmsg() is refactored so that first it copies
the data provided from user space into the send queue,
and then tries to spool the send queue via sendmsg_frag.

There a subtle change in the mptcp level collapsing on
consecutive data fragment: we now allow that only on unsent
data.

The latter don't need to deal with msghdr data anymore
and can be simplified in a relevant way.

snd_nxt and write_seq are now tracked independently.

Overall this allows some relevant cleanup and will
allow sending pending mptcp data on msk una update in
later patch.
