Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: do not shrink snd_nxt when recovering

When recovering after a link failure, snd_nxt should not be set to a
lower value.  Else, update of snd_nxt is broken because:

  msk->snd_nxt += ret; (where ret is number of bytes sent)

assumes that snd_nxt always moves forward.
After reduction, its possible that snd_nxt update gets out of sync:
dfrag we just sent might have had a data sequence number even past
recovery_snd_nxt.

This change factors the common msk state update to a helper
and updates snd_nxt based on the current dfrag data sequence number.

The conditional is required for the recovery phase where we may
re-transmit old dfrags that are before current snd_nxt.

After this change, snd_nxt only moves forward and covers all in-sequence
data that was transmitted.

recovery_snd_nxt is retained to detect when recovery has completed.
