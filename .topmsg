Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: fix length of MP_PRIO suboption

With version 0 of the protocol it was legal to encode the 'Subflow Id' in
the MP_PRIO suboption, to specify which subflow would change its 'Backup'
flag. This has been removed from v1 specification: thus, according to RFC
8684 §3.3.8, the resulting 'Length' for MP_PRIO changed from 4 to 3 byte.

Current Linux generates / parses MP_PRIO according to the old spec, using
'Length' equal to 4, and hardcoding 1 as 'Subflow Id'; RFC compliance can
improve if we change 'Length' in other to become 3, leaving a 'Nop' after
the MP_PRIO suboption. In this way the kernel will emit and accept *only*
MP_PRIO suboptions that are compliant to version 1 of the MPTCP protocol.

 unpatched 5.11-rc kernel:
 [root@bottarga ~]# tcpdump -tnnr unpatched.pcap | grep prio
 reading from file unpatched.pcap, link-type LINUX_SLL (Linux cooked v1)
 dropped privs to tcpdump

Changes since v2:
 - when accounting for option space, don't increment 'TCPOLEN_MPTCP_PRIO'
   and use 'TCPOLEN_MPTCP_PRIO_ALIGN' instead, thanks to Matthieu Baerts.
Changes since v1:
 - refactor patch to avoid using 'TCPOLEN_MPTCP_PRIO' with its old value,
   thanks to Geliang Tang.
