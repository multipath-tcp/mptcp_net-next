Subject: [PATCH] tcp: clean ext on tx recycle

Otherwise we will find stray/unexpected/old extensions value on next
iteration.

On tcp_write_xmit() we can end-up splitting an already queued skb in two
parts, via tso_fragment(). The newly created skb can be allocated via
the tx cache and an upper layer will not be aware of it, so that upper
layer cannot set the ext properly.

Resetting the ext on recycle ensures that stale data is not propagated
in to packet headers or elsewhere.

An alternative would be add an additional hook in tso_fragment() or in
sk_stream_alloc_skb() to init the ext for upper layers that need it.
