Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: recvmsg() can drain data from multiple subflows

With the previous patch in place, the msk can detect which subflow
has the current map with a simple walk, let's update the main
loop to always select the 'current' subflow. The exit conditions now
closely mirror tcp_recvmsg() to get expected timeout and signal
behavior.
