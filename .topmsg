Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: tag sequence_seq with socket state

Paolo Abeni suggested to avoid re-syncing new subflows because
they inherit options from listener. In case options were set on
listener but are not set on mptcp-socket there is no need to
do any synchronisation for new subflows.

This change sets sockopt_seq of new mptcp sockets to the seq of
the mptcp listener sock.

Subflow sequence is set to the embedded tcp listener sk.
Add a comment explaing why sk_state is involved in sockopt_seq
generation.
