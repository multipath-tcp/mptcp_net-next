Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: send out MP_FAIL when data checksum fails

When a bad checksum is detected, set the send_mp_fail flag to send out
the MP_FAIL option.

Add a new function mptcp_has_another_subflow() to check whether there's
only a single subflow.

When multiple subflows are in use, close the affected subflow with a RST
that includes an MP_FAIL option and discard the data with the bad
checksum.

Set the sk_state of the subsocket to TCP_CLOSE, then the flag
MPTCP_WORK_CLOSE_SUBFLOW will be set in subflow_sched_work_if_closed,
and the subflow will be closed.

When a single subfow is in use, temporarily handled by sending MP_FAIL
with a RST too.
