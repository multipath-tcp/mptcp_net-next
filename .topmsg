Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: always parse mptcp options for MPC reqsk

In subflow_syn_recv_sock() we currently skip options parsing
for OoO packet, given that such packets may not carry the relevant
MPC option.

If the peer generates an MPC+data TSO packet and some of the early
segments are lost or get reorder, we server will ignore the peer key,
causing transient, unexpected fallback to TCP.

The solution is always parsing the incoming MPTCP options, and
do the fallback only for in-order packets. This actually cleans
the existing code a bit.
