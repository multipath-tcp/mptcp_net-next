Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: add netlink-based PM

Expose a new netlink family to userspace to control the PM, setting:

 - list of local addresses to be signalled.
 - list of local addresses used to created subflows.
 - maximum number of add_addr option to react

When the msk is fully established, the PM netlink attempts to
announce the 'signal' list via the ADD_ADDR option. Since we
currently lack the ADD_ADDR echo (and related event) only the
first addr is sent.

After exhausting the 'announce' list, the PM tries to create
subflow for each addr in 'local' list, waiting for each
connection to be completed before attempting the next one.

Idea is to add an additional PM hook for ADD_ADDR echo, to allow
the PM netlink announcing multiple addresses, in sequence.
