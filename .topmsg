Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: add skeleton to sync msk socket options to subflows

Handle following cases:
1. setsockopt is called with multiple subflows.
   Change might have to be mirrored to all of them.
   This is done directly in process context/setsockopt call.
2. Outgoing subflow is created after one or several setsockopt()
   calls have been made.  Old setsockopt changes should be
   synced to the new socket.
3. Incoming subflow, after setsockopt call(s).

Cases 2 and 3 are handled right after the join list is spliced to the conn
list.

Not all sockopt values can be just be copied by value, some require
helper calls.  Those can acquire socket lock (which can sleep).

If the join->conn list splicing is done from preemptible context,
synchronization can be done right away, otherwise its deferred to work
queue.
