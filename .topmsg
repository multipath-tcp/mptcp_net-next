Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: generate the data checksum

This patch added a new member named csum in struct mptcp_ext, implemented
a new function named mptcp_generate_data_checksum().

Generate the data checksum in mptcp_sendmsg_frag, save it in mpext->csum.

Note that we must generate the csum for zero window probe, too.

Do the csum update incrementally, to avoid multiple csum computation
when the data is appended to existing skb.

Note that in a later patch we will skip unneeded csum related operation.
Changes not included here to keep the delta small.
