Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: better binary layout for mptcp_options_received

This change reorder the mptcp_options_received fields
to shrink the structure a bit and to ensure the most
frequently used fields are all in the first cacheline.

Sub-opt specific flags are moved out of the suboptions area,
and we must now explicitly set them when the relevant
suboption is parsed.

There is a notable exception: 'csum_reqd' is used by both DSS
and MPC suboptions, and keeping such field in the suboptions
flag area will simplfy the next patch.
