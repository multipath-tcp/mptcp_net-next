Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: recvmsg() can drain data from multiple subflows

With the previous patch in place, the msk can detect which subflow
has the current map with a simple walk, let's update the main
loop to always select the 'current' subflow.

Additionally:
- changes the exit conditions to mirror closely tcp_recvmsg()
this should fix unexpected behavior with timeout and signals.
- avoid unneeded refcounting on ssk
