Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: pm nl: support IPv4 mapped in v6 addresses

On one side, we can allow the creation of subflows between v4 mapped in
v6 and v4 addresses. For that we look for v4mapped addresses between the
local address we want to select and the remote one.

On the other side, we also properly deal with received v4mapped
addresses, either announced ones or set via Netlink.

Fixes: 01cacb00b35c ("mptcp: add netlink-based PM")
Closes: https://github.com/multipath-tcp/mptcp_net-next/issues/122
