Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: add the MP_FAIL testcases

Added the test cases for MP_FAIL, the multiple subflows test for the
MP_RST case and the single subflow one for the infinite mapping case.
The former used the test_linkfail value to make 1024KB test files,
and the latter 128KB.

Added a new function reset_with_fail(), in it use 'iptables' and 'tc
action pedit' rules to produce the bit flips to trigger the checksum
failures. Added a new function pedit_action_pkts() to get the numbers
of the packets edited by the tc pedit actions.

Added a new global variable validate_checksum to enable checksums for
the MP_FAIL tests without passing the '-C' argument.

Also added the needed kernel configures in the selftests config file.
