Subject: [PATCH] DO-NOT-MERGE: mptcp: improve code coverage for CI

tcp: warn if tcp_done() is called on a closed socket

  This is an extra check mainly for the CIs: to make sure we don't call
  tcp_done() on an already closed socket as it happened in the past. If
  we do such call, better to catch the error earlier.

mptcp: warn in case of bogus mpc option on established client sk

  As discussed on [1], an additional check is done to catch local
  software bug.

  This patch is supposed to land only in our tree, for both 'export' and
  'export-net' branches, because the warning could be triggered by
  bugged / malicious peer. We want it in our tree for our CI to detect
  internal bugs.
