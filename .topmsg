Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: rework mptcp_sendmsg_frag to accept optional dfrag

This will simplify mptcp-level retransmission implementation
in the next patch. If dfrag is provided by the caller, skip
kernel space memory allocation and use data and metadata
provided by the dfrag itself.

Because a peer could ack data at TCP level but refrain from
sending mptcp-level ACKs, we could grow the mptcp socket
backlog indefinitely.

We should thus block mptcp_sendmsg until the peer has acked some of the
sent data.

In order to be able to do so, increment the mptcp socket wmem_queued
counter on memory allocation and decrement it when releasing the memory
on mptcp-level ack reception.

Because TCP performns sndbuf auto-tuning up to tcp_wmem_max[2], make
this the mptcp sk_sndbuf limit.

In the future we could add experiment with autotuning as TCP does in
tcp_sndbuf_expand().
