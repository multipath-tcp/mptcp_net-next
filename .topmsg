Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: Write MPTCP DSS headers to outgoing data packets

Per-packet metadata required to write the MPTCP DSS option is written to
the skb_ext area. One write to the socket may contain more than one
packet of data, in which case the DSS option in the first packet will
have a mapping covering all of the data in that write. Packets after the
first do not have a DSS option. This is complicated to handle under
memory pressure, since the first packet (with the DSS mapping) is pushed
to the TCP core before the remaining skbs are allocated.

The current implementation is limited. It will only send up to one page
of data. The number of bytes sent is returned so the caller knows which
bytes were sent and which were not. More work is required to ensure that
it works correctly with full buffers or under memory pressure.

The MPTCP DSS checksum is not yet implemented.
