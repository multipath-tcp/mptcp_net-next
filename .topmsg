Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: Handle incoming 32-bit DATA_FIN values

The peer may send a DATA_FIN mapping with either a 32-bit or 64-bit
sequence number. When a 32-bit sequence number is received for the
DATA_FIN, it must be expanded to 64 bits before comparing it to the
last acked sequence number. This expansion was missing.

Closes: https://github.com/multipath-tcp/mptcp_net-next/issues/93
Fixes: 3721b9b64676 (mptcp: Track received DATA_FIN sequence number and add related helpers)
