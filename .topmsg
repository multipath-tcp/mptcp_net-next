Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: fix races between shutdown and recvmsg

The msk sk_shutdown flag is set by a workqueue, possibly
introducing some delay in user-space notification. If the last
subflow carries some data with the fin packet, the user space
can wake-up before RCV_SHUTDOWN is set. If it executes unblocking
recvmsg(), it may return with an error instead of eof.

Address the issue explicitly checking for eof in recvmsg(), when
no data is found.
