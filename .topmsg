Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: Write MPTCP DSS headers to outgoing data packets

Per-packet metadata required to write the MPTCP DSS option is written to
the skb_ext area. One write to the socket may contain more than one
packet of data, which is copied to page fragments and mapped in to MPTCP
DSS segments with size determined by the available page fragments and
the maximum mapping length allowed by the MPTCP specification. If
do_tcp_sendpages() splits a DSS segment in to multiple skbs, that's ok -
the later skbs can either have duplicated DSS mapping information or
none at all, and the receiver can handle that.

The current implementation uses the subflow frag cache and tcp
sendpages to avoid excessive code duplication. More work is required to
ensure that it works correctly under memory pressure and to support
MPTCP-level retransmissions.

The MPTCP DSS checksum is not yet implemented.
