Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: harmonize locking on all socket operations.

The locking schema implied by sendmsg(), recvmsg(), etc.
requires acquiring the msk's socket lock before manipulating
the msk internal status.

Additionally, we can't acquire the msk->subflow socket lock while holding
the msk lock, due to mptcp_finish_connect().

Many socket operations do not enforce the required locking, e.g. we have
several patterns alike:

	if (msk->subflow)
		// do something with msk->subflow

or:

	if (!msk->subflow)
		// allocate msk->subflow

all without any lock acquired.

They can race with each other and with mptcp_finish_connect() causing
UAF, null ptr dereference and/or memory leaks.

This patch ensures that all mptcp socket operations access and manipulate
msk->subflow under the msk socket lock. To avoid breaking the locking
assumption introduced by mptcp_finish_connect(), while avoiding UAF
issues, we acquire a reference to the msk->subflow, where needed.
