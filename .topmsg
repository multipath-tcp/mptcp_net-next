Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: allow changing the 'backup' bit when no sockets are open

current Linux refuses to change the 'backup' bit of MPTCP endpoints, i.e.
using MPTCP_PM_CMD_SET_FLAGS, unless it finds (at least) one subflow that
matches the endpoint address. There is no reason for that, so we can just
ignore the return value of mptcp_nl_addr_backup(). In this way, endpoints
can reconfigure their 'backup' flag even if no MPTCP sockets are open (or
more generally, in case the MP_PRIO message is not sent out).

Fixes: 0f9f696a502e ("mptcp: add set_flags command in PM netlink")
