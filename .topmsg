Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: clear 'kern' flag from fallback sockets

The mptcp ULP extension relies on sk->sk_sock_kern being set correctly:
It prevents setsockopt(fd, IPPROTO_TCP, TCP_ULP, "mptcp", 6); from
working for plain tcp sockets (any userspace-exposed socket).

But in case of fallback, accept() can return a plain tcp sk.
In such case, sk is still tagged as 'kernel' and setsockopt will work.

This will crash the kernel, The subflow extension has a NULL ctx->conn
mptcp socket:

BUG: KASAN: null-ptr-deref in subflow_data_ready+0x181/0x2b0
Call Trace:
 tcp_data_ready+0xf8/0x370
