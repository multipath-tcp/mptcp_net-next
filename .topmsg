Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: re-check dsn before reading from subflow

mptcp_subflow_data_available() is commonly called via
ssk->sk_data_ready(), in this case the mptcp socket lock
cannot be acquired.

Therefore, while we can safely discard subflow data that
was already received up to msk->ack_seq, we cannot be sure
that 'subflow->data_avail' will still be valid at the time
userspace wants to read the data -- a previous read on a
different subflow might have carried this data already.

In that (unlikely) event, msk->ack_seq will have been updated
and will be ahead of the subflow dsn.

We can check for this condition and skip/resync to the expected
sequence number.
