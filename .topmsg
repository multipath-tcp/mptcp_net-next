Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: add remove cfg in mptcp_connect

This patch added a new cfg, named cfg_remove in mptcp_connect. This new
cfg_remove is copied from cfg_join. The only difference between them is in
the do_rnd_write function. Here we slow down the transfer process of all
data to let the RM_ADDR suboption can be sent and received completely.
Otherwise the remove address and subflow test cases don't work.
