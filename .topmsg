Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: don't return sockets in foreign netns

mptcp_token_get_sock() may return a mptcp socket that is in
a different net namespace than the socket that received the token value.

The mptcp syncookie code path had an explicit check for this,
this moves the test into mptcp_token_get_sock() function.

Eventually token.c should be converted to pernet storage, but
such change is not suitable for net tree.
