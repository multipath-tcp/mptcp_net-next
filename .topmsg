Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: fix subflow's local_id issues

In mptcp_pm_nl_get_local_id, skc_local is the same as msk_local, so it
always return 0. Thus every subflow's local_id is 0. It's incorrect.

This patch fixed this issue.

Also, we need to ignore the zero address here, like 0.0.0.0 in IPv4. When
we use the zero address as a local address, it means that we can use any
one of the local addresses. The zero address is not a new address, we don't
need to add it to PM, so this patch added a new function address_zero to
check whether an address is the zero address, if it is, we ignore this
address.
