Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: receive checksum for MP_CAPABLE with data

This patch added a new member named csum in struct mptcp_options_received.

When parsing the MP_CAPABLE with data, if the checksum is enabled,
adjust the expected_opsize. If the receiving option length matches the
length with the data checksum, get the checksum value and save it in
mp_opt->csum. And in mptcp_incoming_options, pass it to mpext->csum.

We always parse any csum/nocsum combination and delay the presence check
to later code, to allow reset if missing.

Additionally, in the TX path, use the newly introduce ext field to avoid
MPTCP csum recomputation on TCP retransmission and unneeded csum update
on when setting the data fin_flag.
