Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: fix diag instability

Instead of waiting for an arbitrary amount of time for the MPTCP
MP_CAPABLE handshake to complete, explicitly wait for the relevant
socket to enter into the established status.

Additionally let the data transfer application use the slowest
transfer mode available (-r), to cope with very slow host, or
high jitter caused by hosting VMs.

Fixes: df62f2ec3df6 ("selftests/mptcp: add diag interface tests")
Closes: https://github.com/multipath-tcp/mptcp_net-next/issues/258
