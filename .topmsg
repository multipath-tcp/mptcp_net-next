Subject: [PATCH] net: mptcp: clean up harmless false expressions

entry->addr.id is u8 with a range from 0 to 255 and MAX_ADDR_ID is 255.
We should drop both false expressions of (entry->addr.id > MAX_ADDR_ID).

We should also remove the obsolete parentheses in the first if branch.

Use U8_MAX for MAX_ADDR_ID and add a comment to show the link to
mptcp_addr_info.id as suggested by Mr. Matthieu Baerts.
