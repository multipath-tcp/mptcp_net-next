Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: dump more info on errors

Even if that may sound completely unlikely, the mptcp implementation
is not perfect, yet.

When the self-tests report an error we usually need more information
of what the scripts currently report. iproute allow provides
some additional goodies since a few releases, let's dump them.
