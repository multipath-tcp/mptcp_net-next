Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: Support for IP_TOS for MPTCP setsockopt()

SOL_IP provides a way to configure network layer attributes in a
socket. This patch adds support for IP_TOS for setsockopt(.. ,SOL_IP, ..)

Support for SOL_IP is added in mptcp_setsockopt() and IP_TOS is handled in
a private function. The idea here is to take in the value passed for IP_TOS
and set it to the current subflow, open subflows as well new subflows that
might be created after the initial call to setsockopt(). This sync is done
using sync_socket_options(.., ssk) and setting the value of tos using
__ip_sock_set_tos(ssk,..).

The patch has been tested using the packetdrill script here -
