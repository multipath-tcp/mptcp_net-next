Subject: [PATCH] inet_connection_sock: clear inet_num out of destroy helper

Clearing the 'inet_num' field is necessary and safe if and
only if the socket is not bound. The MPTCP protocol calls
the destroy helper on bound sockets, as tcp_v{4,6}_syn_recv_sock
completed successfully.

Move the clearing of such field out of the common code, otherwise
the MPTCP MP_JOIN error path will find the wrong 'inet_num' value
on socket disposal, __inet_put_port() will acquire the wrong lock
and bind_node removal could race with other modifiers possibly
corrupting the bind hash table.
