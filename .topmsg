Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: try to set mptcp ulp mode in different sk states

The kernel will crash without
'mptcp: clear 'kern' flag from fallback sockets' change.

Since this doesn't slow down testing in a noticeable way,
run this unconditionally.

The explicit test did not catch this, because the check was done
for tcp socket returned by 'socket(.. IPPROTO_TCP) rather than a
tcp socket returned by accept() on a mptcp listen fd.
