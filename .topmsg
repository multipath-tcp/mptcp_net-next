Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: unify RM_ADDR and RM_SUBFLOW receiving

There are some duplicate code in mptcp_pm_nl_rm_addr_received and
mptcp_pm_nl_rm_subflow_received. This patch unifies them into a new
function named mptcp_pm_nl_rm_addr_or_subflow. In it, use the input
parameter rm_type to identify it's now removing an address or a subflow.
