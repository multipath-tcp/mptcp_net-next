Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: fix corrupt receiver key in MPC + data + checksum

using packetdrill it's possible to observe that the receiver key contains
random values when clients transmit MP_CAPABLE with data and checksum (as
specified in RFC8684 §3.1). Fix the layout of mptcp_out_options, to avoid
using the skb extension copy when writing the MP_CAPABLE sub-option.

Fixes: d7b269083786 ("mptcp: shrink mptcp_out_options struct")
Closes: https://github.com/multipath-tcp/mptcp_net-next/issues/233
