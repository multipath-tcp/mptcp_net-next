Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: support SYSCTL only if enabled

Since the introduction of the sysctl support in MPTCP with
commit 784325e9f037 ("mptcp: new sysctl to control the activation per NS"),
we don't check CONFIG_SYSCTL.

Until now, that was not an issue: the register and unregister functions
were replaced by NO-OP one if SYSCTL was not enabled in the config. The
only thing we could have avoid is not to reserve memory for the table
but that's for the moment only a small table per net-ns.

But the following commit is going to use SYSCTL_ZERO and SYSCTL_ONE
which are not be defined if SYSCTL is not enabled in the config. This
causes 'undefined reference' errors from the linker.
