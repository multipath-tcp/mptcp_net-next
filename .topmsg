Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: implement dummy MSG_ERRQUEUE support

mptcp_recvmsg() currently silently ignores MSG_ERRQUEUE, returning
input data instead of error cmsg.

This change provides a dummy implementation for MSG_ERRQUEUE - always
returns no data. That is consistent with the current lack of a suitable
IP_RECVERR setsockopt() support.
