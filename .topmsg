Subject: [PATCH] selftests/bpf: Add bpf scheduler test

This patch extends the MPTCP test base to support MPTCP packet scheduler
tests. Add a new test to use the default in-kernel scheduler.

In the new helper sched_init(), add two veth net devices to simulate the
multiple addresses case. Use 'ip mptcp endpoint' command to add the new
endpoint ADDR_2 to PM netlink. Use sysctl to set net.mptcp.scheduler to
use the given sched.

Invoke start_mptcp_server() to start the server on ADDR_1, and invoke
connect_to_fd() to connect with the server from the client. Then invoke
send_data() to send data.

Some code in send_data() is from prog_tests/bpf_tcp_ca.c.

Add time metrics for BPF tests to compare the performance of each
schedulers. Run prog_tests with '-v' option can print out the running
time of each test.

Use the new helper has_bytes_sent() to check the bytes_sent filed of 'ss'
output after send_data() to make sure no data has been sent on ADDR_2.
All data has been sent on the first subflow.

Invoke the new helper sched_cleanup() to set back net.mptcp.scheduler to
default, flush all mptcp endpoints, and delete the veth net devices.
