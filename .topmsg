Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: faster active backup recovery

The msk can use backup subflows to transmit in-sequence data
only if there are no other active subflow. On active backup
scenario, the MPTCP connection can do forward progress only
due to MPTCP retransmissions - rtx can pick backup subflows.

This patch introduces a new flag flow MPTCP subflows: if the
underlying TCP connection made no progresses for long time,
and there are other less problematic subflows available, the
given subflow become stale.

Stale subflows are not considered active: if all non backup
subflows become stale, the MPTCP scheduler can pick backup
subflows for plain transmissions.

Stale subflows can return in active state, as soon as any reply
from the peer is observed.

Active backup scenarios can now leverage the available b/w
with no restrinction.
