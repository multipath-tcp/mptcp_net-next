Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: Add MPTCP socket stubs

Implements the infrastructure for MPTCP sockets.

MPTCP sockets open one in-kernel TCP socket per subflow. These subflow
sockets are only managed by the MPTCP socket that owns them and are not
visible from userspace. This commit allows a userspace program to open
an MPTCP socket with:

  sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_MPTCP);

The resulting socket is simply a wrapper around a single regular TCP
socket, without any of the MPTCP protocol implemented over the wire.
