Subject: [PATCH] net: introduce sk_forward_alloc_get()

A later patch will change the MPTCP memory accounting schema
in such a way that MPTCP sockets will encode the total amount of
forward allocated memory in two separate fields (one for tx and
one for rx).

MPTCP sockets will use their own helper to provide the accurate
amount of fwd allocated memory.

To allow the above, this patch adds a new, optional, sk method to
fetch the fwd memory, wrap the call in a new helper and use it
where it is apprioriated.
