Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: add port support for ADD_ADDR suboption writing

In rfc8684, the length of ADD_ADDR suboption with IPv4 address and port
is 18 octets, but mptcp_write_options is 32-bit aligned, so we need to
pad it to 20 octets. All the other port related option lengths need to
be added up 2 octets similarly.

This patch added a new field 'port' in mptcp_out_options. When this
field is set with a port number, we need to add up 4 octets for the
ADD_ADDR suboption, and put the port number into the suboption.
