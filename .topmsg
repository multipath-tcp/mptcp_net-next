Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: Use 32-bit DATA_ACK when possible

RFC8684 allows to send 32-bit DATA_ACKs as long as the peer is not
sending 64-bit data-sequence numbers. The 64-bit DSN is only there for
extreme scenarios when a very high throughput subflow is combined with a
long-RTT subflow such that the high-throughput subflow wraps around the
32-bit sequence number space within an RTT of the high-RTT subflow.

It is thus a rare scenario and we should try to use the 32-bit DATA_ACK
instead as long as possible. It allows to reduce the TCP-option overhead
by 4 bytes, thus makes space for an additional SACK-block. It also makes
tcpdumps much easier to read when the DSN and DATA_ACK are both either
32 or 64-bit.
