Subject: [PATCH] mptcp: add MPTCP_INFO getsockopt

Its not compatible with multipath-tcp.org kernel one.

1. The out-of-tree implementation defines a different 'struct mptcp_info',
   with embedded __user addresses for additional data such as
   endpoint addresses.

2. Mat Martineau points out that embedded __user addresses doesn't work
with BPF_CGROUP_RUN_PROG_GETSOCKOPT() which assumes that copying in
optsize bytes from optval provides all data that got copied to userspace.

This provides mptcp_info data for the given mptcp socket.

Userspace sets optlen to the size of the structure it expects.
The kernel updates it to contain the number of bytes that it copied.

This allows to append more information to the structure later.
