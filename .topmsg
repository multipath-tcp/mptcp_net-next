Subject: [PATCH] selftests: mptcp: clean tmp files in simult_flows

'$cin' and '$sin' variables are local to a function: they are then not
available from the cleanup trap.

Instead, we need to use '$large' and '$small' that are not local and
defined just before setting the trap.

Without this patch, running this script in a loop might cause a:

  write: No space left on device

issue.
