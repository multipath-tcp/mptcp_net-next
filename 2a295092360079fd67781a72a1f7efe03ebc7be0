Or maybe delete all the local topic branches and redo the \"tg remote $url --populate\" command?\n\nYes, both should work. I am not a big fan of the \"tg tag\" / \"tg revert\" because we might have other issues (what about old tags, etc.). I can also delete all local topic branches but while doing that, is it not better to directly link them to the remote refs?",
