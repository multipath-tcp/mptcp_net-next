**Up-to-date kernel?**
<!-- Did you try to reproduce the issue with ideally the last stable kernel version, or at least the last LTS version (or the development version using our `export` branch?
See https://www.kernel.org for the supported versions -->

**Additional context**
<!--
Add any other context about the problem here.
Note: It might help to get the output of  `ip mptcp monitor` while reproducing the issue, in addition to the output from these commands executed just before **and** after the issue:
```
ss -ManiH
nstat
```
Packet traces (TCPDump / WireShark) can be helpful too. See https://www.mptcp.dev/debugging.html for more details.
mptcpd's `mptcp-get-debug` script (mptcpd >= 0.13) can help to collect such infos: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/multipath-tcp/mptcpd/refs/heads/main/scripts/mptcp-get-debug
